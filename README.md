KinSence

This allows you to use Kinect with in any programming language, as long as it is capable of connecting through TCP and reading JSON data.

Included modules:<br />
* Full skeleton tracking<br />
* Hand tracking<br />
* Voice recognition

Right now the repository contains the C# KinSence desktop application and a Flash client application.
